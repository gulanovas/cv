      <p class="box"><em>I strongly believe that if you aim at your goals persistently
          and well devote yourself to the field of science of interest,
          you can become a great and successful specialist in the sphere you have chosen.
          For me, the field I want to achieve high results in and improve myself comprehensively is Data Sciences.
        </em></p>
      <p class="box"><em>Behind the geeky person I am writing articles, commercial and creative texts.
          Writing is great opportunity to analyze specific topics and keep my interest for newest technologies,
          cyber security, marketing, planet friendly opportunities and many other topics.
          Writing helping me not only to follow information about topics I like but as well helping to improve my
          analytical skills and critical thinking. All these skills are super useful in programming.
          I found it especially helpful when visualizing data and creating dashboards it helps to look at datasets
          from different corner and better understand it. However, not only data visualizing requires good analytical
          skills in programming I found that you need not only know how to do but to know how to make a project plan,
          analyze it, count time, understand methods which needs to be used to done specific task and much more...
        </em></p>
      <p class="box"><em> Moreover, I am learning polish language and trying to improve it every day. Languages I found as a great
          thing to learn how to learn sounds silly but it is way to learn follow the rules.
          Simply by that I mean that if you want to understand grammar of language
          you need to know rules and when and how you need to use them. By these rules builded all language.
          What I found very similar to programming languages.
