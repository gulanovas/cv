        <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/goal" title="Goal icons created by Flat Icons - Flaticon"><img class="left-img" src="images/goal.png" alt="Goal"></a>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>I strongly believe that if you aim at your goals persistently and well devote yourself to the field of science of interest, you can become a great and successful specialist in the sphere you have chosen. For me, the
          field I want to achieve high results and improve myself comprehensively is Data Sciences(Data analysis; Machine learning; Deep learning).</p>

        <h3>Strategic</h3>
        <p>Strategic thinking helps me sort through the clutter and find the best route. This perspective allows me to see patterns where others simply see complexity. Mindful of these patterns, I like to play out alternative scenarios, by always
          asking, “What if this happened?</p>

        <h3>Learner</h3>
        <p>Learner the subject matter that interests me the most will be determined by my other themes and experiences, but whatever the subject, I will always be drawn to the process of learning. Sometimes, the process, more than the content or the
          result, is especially exciting for me. </p>

        <h3>Intellectual </h3>
        <p>I like mental activity and exercising my brain muscle. I like to have an interest in multiple fields, which I can connect and create something by using both of them. For example IT knowledge and marketing knowledge, journalism, and IT. I
          think it is a great way to create good quality products.</p>

        <h3>Futuristic </h3>
        <p>The future fascinates me. As if it were projected on the wall, I see in detail what the future might hold, and this detailed picture keeps pulling me forward, into tomorrow. While the exact content of the picture will depend on my other
          strengths and interests—a better product, a better team, a better life, or a better world—it will always be inspirational for me.</p>

      <div class="text-row">
        <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/python" title="Python icons created by Freepik - Flaticon"><img class="left-img" src="images/python.png" alt="Python"></a>
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>I found my passion for Python since I learned to write hello world in university. That was my first steps in programming. Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience with Python by completing several tutorials, creating basic projects, such as<a href="https://github.com/gulanovas/oldprojects/blob/master/pw_generator.py">Random password generator</a>and<a href="https://github.com/gulanovas/projects/blob/main/hangman.py">Hangman</a>and much more..</p>

        <h3>Flask</h3>
        <p>Flask and Django two super powerfull Python back-end frameworks. However, Flask is more flexible and suitable for small projects, as my main goal to work with datascience I found that Flask might be more useful to implement Machine Learning models or dashboards to websites. Flask I learned by creating such a project as<a href="https://github.com/gulanovas/bookstore">bookstore</a>. This project was my first website creating experience</p>

        <h3>Data analysis and Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Data analysis and Machine learning subject where I am always finding myself most passionate about. Create Machine learning models and analyse data is something what gives me second breath. One of my first analysis are <a href="https://github.com/gulanovas/obesity/blob/main/second_try_obesity.ipynb">Obesity dataset</a>. I found it super interesting to work with and keep improving myself by creting better Machine learning models and dashboards.</p>

        <h3>SQL</h3>
        <p>SQL - Structured Query Language are one of most popular database tools what is used in any kind of project from websites to Datascience projects. I use mostly SQL lite when creating websites. SQL helps to filter and update data without too much effort.</p>

        <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/software-development" title="Software development icons created by Pixel perfect - Flaticon"><img class="left-img" src="images/settings.png" alt="C++"></a>
        <h3>C++ </h3>
        <p>C++ learned most basics of it and time by time improving myself by creating simple projects. Mostly learned it in University and realised that it can be used when working on big Python projects and need to improve perfomance. Because Python sometimes takes too long to run specific functions.</p>
